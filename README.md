# Phone-Detox-App
 A project that replicates the one-sec app, which helps people reduce their phone usage by asking them to select apps that they want to block and when they try to open them, they will be asked to wait for a second to think about whether they really want to open the app or not. If not, they do journaling instead.

## Tasks
- [] Select blocked apps and store them in a local database
- [] Detect when a blocked app is opened
- [] Show a dialog asking the user to wait for a second or do journaling
- [] Statistics tab: how many times the user opened the blocked apps in a day, week, month, year
- [] Journaling feature: 
    - [] Add a journal
    - [] View all journals
    - [] Send weekly report to the user

## Languages: 
Kotlin (using Jetpack Compose for UI)
